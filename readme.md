#### When a user adds their media files, Flixie will retrieve and store IMDB information for all of their movies and TV shows and sort it into a library. Users can also view and stream movie files from other computers, simply by being on the same network. If any users want to enjoy a movie together, Flixie provides Chromecast support so that they can watch on a TV or any other Chromecast enabled device.
